# ROKU SCENEGRAPH CRASH COURSE
based on https://github.com/learnroku/crash-course  tutorial from 2017

This is tutorial with simplified english. Some links were corrected, where needed. Code  stayed the same.  
The goal of this work is to make english of this tutorial more understandable for non native english speakers.
I try to explain the same with less sophisticated words.
